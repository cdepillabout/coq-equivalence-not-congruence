## About

Welcome to the Equivalence Not Congruence for Imp project website!

This project contains a Coq proof of an equivalence relation on the Imp
language that is not congruent. This answers a question from the
[Program Equivalence (Equiv)](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/Equiv.html)
chapter of
[Programming Language Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html), which is the
second book of [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/).
This proof is suggested in
this [answer on the Computer Science StackExchange](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/98873/130503).
