This project contains a Coq proof of an equivalence relation on the Imp
language that is not congruent. This answers a question from the
[Program Equivalence (Equiv)](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/Equiv.html)
chapter of
[Programming Language Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html), which is the
second book of [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/).
This proof is suggested in
this [answer on the Computer Science StackExchange](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/98873/130503).

## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Equivalence Not Congruence for Imp
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-coq-equivalence-not-congruence
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/cdepillabout/coq-equivalence-not-congruence.git
cd coq-equivalence-not-congruence
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
make install
```


## Documentation

### Building

If you're using Nix, you can get into a shell with Coq available by running
`nix develop`:

```console
$ nix develop
```

You can build all the Coq files in this repo with `make`:

```console
$ make
```

After building, you can open up any of the files in
[`theories/`](./theories/) in `coqide` in order to work through the proofs.

You can regenerate the files in this repo (like `README.md`) from the
[`meta.yml`](./meta.yml) file by cloning
[`coq-community/templates`](https://github.com/coq-community/templates) and
running `generate.sh`:

```console
$ /some/path/to/coq-community/templates/generate.sh
```

### Overview

The [Program Equivalence (Equiv)](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/Equiv.html)
chapter of
[Programming Language Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html)
has a question like the following:

> We've shown that the `cequiv` relation is both an equivalence and
> a congruence on commands.  Can you think of a relation on commands
> that is an equivalence but _not_ a congruence?

There is an
[answer to this question on on the Computer Science StackExchange](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/98873/130503):

> Let `x`, `y` be two fixed distinct variable names.
>
> Call `P` and `Q` equivalent iff `Q` is obtained from `P` by optionally
> swapping the variable names `x` and `y`. That is, either `Q = P` or
> `Q = P{x/y,y/x}` where the latter uses simultaneous substitution.
>
> It is an equivalence. Reflexivity follows by construction. For symmetry,
> `P == Q` swaps if `Q == P` swaps (where `==` is the equivalence relation).
> For transitivity, we consider the four
> cases: in the swap-swap case we get the same program back.
>
> It is not a congruence since `(x := x + 1) == (y := y + 1)` and
> `(x := 0) == (x := 0)`, but `(x := 0; x := x + 1) =/= (x := 0; y := y + 1)`

The [`theories/RenameVars.v`](./theories/RenameVars.v) file has a formalization of this equivalence
relation on the Imp language, as well as a proof that there is no congruence
in this case.
