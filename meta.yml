synopsis: Coq proof of an equivalence relation that is not congruent on the Imp language.

description: |-
  This project contains a Coq proof of an equivalence relation on the Imp
  language that is not congruent. This answers a question from the
  [Program Equivalence (Equiv)](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/Equiv.html)
  chapter of
  [Programming Language Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/index.html), which is the
  second book of [Software Foundations](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/).
  This proof is suggested in
  this [answer on the Computer Science StackExchange](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/98873/130503).

  ### Building

  You can build by running `make`.  If you're using Nix, you can get into
  a shell with Coq available by running `nix develop`.

  After building, you can open up any of the files in
  [`theories/`](./theories/) in `coqide` order to
  work through it.
